# First "Hello Microverse" 

> Setting up a "Hello Microverse" project
It's a simple "Hello world" repository. No complex coding was required for this exercise. The goal here is to master all of the tools and best practices I learned. 
This should be used in all Microverse projects and most likely in a future job as well, so it is important to use them !
